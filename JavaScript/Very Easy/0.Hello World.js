//This is an introduction to how challenges works. 
//In the Code tab above you'll see a starter function that looks like this:

function HelloWorld(){

    
}

//All you have to do is type return "Hello World" between 
//the curly braces { } and then click the run button and you will see 
//result on your terminal or console of browser. 

console.log(HelloWorld())
HelloWorld()==="Hello World"? console.log("Result: Passed!"):console.log("Result:Failed!");
